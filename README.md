Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services like servers, data storage, networking and computing power that do not  require direct active management by the user. Basically, you are renting resources where you pay for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services in cloud computing and it is chosen by many based on its flexibility, reliability, scalability, easy of use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. These include a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings.

In this repository I will demonstrate, through projects,  what I am learning.
